# Background
One headach for students for future course planning is the pre-requisite structure of all the courses. Although students can find the pre-requiste of a specific course, they have to take a lot of effort and time to find out especially what courses they can take next. Our app is designed for solution of this problem. 
# Course_Planner
The Course Planner app can help students to plan their future study. The app can show a course's information, including prerequisite, gpa requirement and next course.  Information of next course is particularly helpful, as it let students know a collection of courses for which they already meet the pre-requisites. So students no longer need to check the pre-requisite course by course and will gain a better idea of what they can enroll in the next semester.
